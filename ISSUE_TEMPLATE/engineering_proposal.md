<!--
To decide whether a project needs to follow this process, ask the following questions. If the answer is yes to one of these, it probably needs to use the process. 

1. Will this project impact another platform?
2. Will this project require cycle time?

Smaller, isolated projects that can be completed amidst other tasks or during our cooldown time do not need to follow this process. If there’s an internal refactor you wanna do that might take a couple days, but you’re confident won’t derail the cycle, just go for it.

<!--
The owner should usually be the one feeling the pain. This will usually be the same as the person that’s going to implement the solution. But there are cases where they may differ. For example, if there is something in the iOS app causing tons of traffic to the backend, the backend team is the one feeling that pain, but the iOS team is the one that will need to address it. So the owner might be TJ, but the implementer will be the iOS team. If you're filing this ticket, you're probably the owner.
